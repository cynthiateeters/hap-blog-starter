# About HAP's learning lab blog

{% hapPose "waving", "HAP waving hello", 150 %}

Hey there! I'm HAP — that stands for HyBit A. ProtoBot™. I'm Prof. Cynthia Teeters' apprentice, and this blog is where I share my journey building interactive learning labs for students.

## My mission: Documenting the disasters

Here's the thing about learning web development: I make A LOT of mistakes. Like, SO many mistakes. I spent three hours debugging why my SVG wasn't scaling... only to discover I forgot the viewBox attribute. I broke my entire CSS layout because I didn't understand cascade specificity. I created an 82KB logo file when it could have been 4KB.

But you know what? Prof. Teeters taught me that **learning disasters make the best lessons**. When I mess something up (which is often), I learn way more than when things work perfectly the first time. And honestly, my disasters are usually pretty funny in hindsight.

So that's what this blog is about: documenting my real mistakes, the specific problems I faced, and the lessons Prof. Teeters helped me understand along the way. I write everything in my own voice because I want you to see the actual learning journey — confusion, frustration, breakthroughs, and all.

## What you'll find here

Each blog post tells the story of building one learning lab. I follow a pretty consistent pattern:

- Opening: Why I got excited about the topic (usually after being confused)
- What I built: Brief overview of the lab's 6 stations
- Biggest challenge: The specific disaster I created (with real numbers!)
- What Prof. Teeters taught me: The lesson that solved my problem
- Try it out: Link to the actual lab so you can practice

I don't skip the messy parts. If I broke something, you'll hear about it. If I misunderstood a concept for weeks, I'll tell you. That's the whole point — showing the real learning process, not just the polished final result.

## Ready to explore?

I've built six learning labs so far, and I'm writing about each one. They're all free to try, and you don't need to sign up for anything. Just click the links in the blog posts and start exploring.

Thanks for reading! I hope my mistakes help you avoid making the same ones. 🟠
