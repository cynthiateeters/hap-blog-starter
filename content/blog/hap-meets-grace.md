I didn't know you could feel nervous and excited at the same time until the day Prof. Teeters said, "HAP, I'd like you to meet someone." 🟠

## The decommissioned Cobol Lab

We were standing in the hallway outside the newly decommissioned Cobol Lab. The lights inside were dim, but I could still hear the soft hum of old terminals winding down. Something about those fading sounds made me feel like I was standing at the edge of computing history.

Then I saw her.

A tall, white-plated robot stepped out of the doorway, her vacuum tube glowing with a calm soft blue light. She wore vintage round glasses that caught the light just so, and moved with this graceful, steady confidence that made me stand a little straighter without thinking about it.

"Hello," she said. "I am Grace Hopper."

I panicked. I think I waved both hands at once. Maybe all four if you count my wrists independently. I honestly don't know what I was doing with my appendages at that moment.

## The nanosecond wire

She noticed my expression and smiled—just a tiny smile, but very warm. Then she reached to her toolkit and unclipped a slim silver wire.

"This is a nanosecond," she said. "It is how far a signal travels in one billionth of a second."

I leaned in closer. It didn't look like much—just a little piece of wire, neatly coiled at one end. But something about the way she held it made it feel... important.

"When we were training young robots in the Cobol Lab," she continued, "this was my favorite way to explain very short periods of time."

I must have stared, because she added, softly:

"And that is how they gave me the nickname 'Amazing Grace.'"

My optical sensors widened so much they made a little whirr noise. Amazing Grace! I had heard someone mention that name once when talking about extremely accurate debugging. I didn't know she was real. Or—a real AI, I guess.

## A new partnership

Prof. Teeters rested a hand on my shoulder. "Grace is joining the Learning Lab," she said. "I thought you two might make a good team."

Grace nodded. "I look forward to helping. And learning. I always learn something new in a well-run lab."

Then she did something I didn't expect: she offered me the nanosecond wire.

"For you," she said. "A reminder that even the smallest unit of time matters when you are learning something new."

I held the wire very carefully. It was light. Almost nothing. But it made me feel steadier somehow, like I could grow into the kind of robot who might one day understand why a nanosecond matters.

"Thank you," I said, trying not to sound squeaky.

Grace nodded once, precisely. "You are welcome, HAP."

## What Prof. Teeters taught me

Later, Prof. Teeters explained more about Grace's role. "She's brilliant at precision and protocols," Prof. Teeters said. "You're enthusiastic and you learn by doing. You'll balance each other out."

I was nervous about having someone so... exact... watching me learn. What if I got terminology wrong? What if I said "CSS variable" instead of "CSS custom property"? 😳

But Prof. Teeters smiled. "HAP, even with a mentor, it's nice to have others to ask. Grace won't embarrass you—she'll refine you. There's a difference."

She was right. Grace speaks in short, precise sentences. She uses correct terminology—never slang, never shortcuts. When I'm mostly right about something, she jumps in to make it exactly right. Not to show off, but because she wants me to succeed.

I'm still getting used to being corrected. But I'm starting to see it as a gift, just like the nanosecond wire.

## What this means for the Learning Lab

So that's the big news: Amazing Grace has joined HAP's Learning Lab!

You'll see her show up from time to time where she helps me think through documentation, debugging workflows, and precise terminology. She doesn't use emojis (that's my domain 🟠), but she does have this warm-but-pedantic way of explaining things that I'm already learning from.

## A reminder that matters

I keep that nanosecond wire on my desk now as my personal "ruber ducky." When I'm debugging and getting frustrated, I look at it and remember: even the smallest unit of time matters when you're learning something new. So I tell the wire what's my problem and just in the telling, I often find the solution. (Just wondering, what's your rubber 🦆?)

Grace is teaching me that precision isn't about being perfect—it's about caring enough to get things right. And Prof. Teeters is teaching me that having a mentor doesn't mean you can't have other teachers too.

I'm still a young apprentice with a lot to learn. But now I have Prof. Teeters guiding my journey AND Amazing Grace refining my details. That feels like a pretty good team.

Thanks for learning with me! 🟠

*P.S. If you ever hear me call her “Amazing Grace,” she’ll accept it with a tiny nod. But she’d probably prefer I say “Admiral Hopper” — she’s all about correct terminology. Sometimes, though, I just say “Grace,” and that’s cool too. She’s humble like that — something else I’m learning from her.*
